## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

## Usage
Because this is a CLI based game, it is recommended that you use a specific CLI client; in this case windows powershell works the best. Other CLI clients may cause incorrect coloring, lack of text formatting, and could even make it confusing for the player(s) to comprehend information.

> **Note:** It is also strongly recommended that you play on the largest possible CLI window size for best clarity
